| General topic       | climate change may reduce the ability of soils to absorb water in many parts of the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Procedure           | During a 25 year experiment in Kansas that involved irrigation of prairie soil with sprinklers. A Rutgers-led team of scientists found that a 35% increase in rainfall led to a 21-33% reduction in water infiltration rates in soil and only a small increase in water retention. The next step is to investigate the mechanisms driving the observed changes.   |
| conclusion          | the scientist would like to extrapolate the findings to other regions of the world and they want to study a wider array of environmental factors, soil types and identify other soil changes that may result from climate change                                                                                                                                 |
