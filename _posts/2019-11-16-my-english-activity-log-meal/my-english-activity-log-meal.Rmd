I often try to speak in english with my friends and with people around the world by "hello talks" app

october 25th : i starded listening the music with my friends and we tried to translate it french.

november 5th : i downloaded the "Hello talks" app. I speak in english with people around the world. It's very interesting because i meet new people and talk about everything. For example, i discove that there is "a dog day" in austria at university
